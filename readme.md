A simple and user-friendly Desktop App created using Python as a miniproject for the Python Miniproject 1A Submission.  

It allows to load the patient records from the excel file and add/delete patient details, edit the table data, search for patient records, generate analytics and more.  

_To test it out, run the PMS.exe from the dist folder. (No installation required)_  

### Technologies Used: ###
* PyQt5 for GUI
* SQLite3 as the database
* pandas for reading/writing data
* Matplotlib for the graph
* Numpy fo the graph
* Converted to exe using PyInstaller
